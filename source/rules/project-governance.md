##  The Role of the Project Leader

The project leader holds ultimate responsibility for all significant decisions in the project. This includes long-term strategic direction, core feature sets, and conflict resolution. While community input and contributions are encouraged, the project leader has the final say.

## Project Administrators

Project administrators ensure smooth communication and operation within the project’s community, moderating discussions, and managing community-related resources such as forums or user groups. While they do not have the final say in technical decisions, they play a vital role in maintaining a healthy, supportive environment for contributors and users alike.

## Core Maintainers

Core maintainers, also known as developers, are integral to the success of the project, acting as the custodians of its codebase and ensuring the quality and integrity of contributions. They review and merge pull requests, enforce coding standards, and provide guidance to contributors, fostering a collaborative and innovative atmosphere. Core maintainers also work closely with the project leader to align on strategic goals and technical direction, serving as liaisons between the community and the leadership. Their expertise and commitment help drive the project forward while upholding its values and vision.

## Insiders Program

Insiders, also known as testers, play a crucial role in ensuring the quality and reliability of the project before public releases. By rigorously testing new features, identifying bugs, and providing detailed feedback, they help to uncover potential issues early in the development process. Their efforts contribute to the stability of the project and ensure that updates meet the highest standards of performance and usability. Insiders' valuable input allows core maintainers to address issues swiftly and refine the user experience, making them essential contributors to the project’s ongoing success. Anyone can be an Insider for the project.

## Project Comptroller

The project comptroller is responsible for overseeing the financial aspects of the project, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently and transparently. They manage budgets, track expenditures, and report on financial performance to the project leadership and community. By maintaining financial accountability, the comptroller helps to ensure that the project operates sustainably and can continue to grow and innovate. They also play a key role in securing funding, whether through grants, sponsorships, or community contributions, thereby enabling the project to achieve its long-term goals while fostering trust and confidence among stakeholders.[^1]

## Project Moderators

Moderators and game moderators are essential to maintaining a positive and respectful community within the project. They monitor discussions, enforce community guidelines, and facilitate healthy interactions among members, ensuring that all voices are heard and valued. Game moderators, in particular, focus on overseeing gameplay experiences, addressing player concerns, and resolving conflicts to ensure fair play. By actively engaging with the community and providing support, both moderators and game moderators help create an inclusive environment that encourages participation, collaboration, and enjoyment for all users.

## Repository Maintainers

Repository maintainers play a crucial role in upholding the quality and integrity of user-generated content. They are responsible for reviewing submissions, ensuring they meet established guidelines and standards before being integrated into the repository. By providing constructive feedback and support to mod creators, repository maintainers foster a collaborative environment that encourages creativity and innovation.

## Inviteds

A unique role for exceptional community members who possess moderator powers aimed at addressing user needs more efficiently.
