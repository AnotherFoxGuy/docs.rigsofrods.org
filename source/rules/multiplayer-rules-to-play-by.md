# Multiplayer Rules to Play By

!!! abstract "TL;DR"
    Everything from our Community Guidelines apply here. Don't be a jerk when playing multiplayer. Everything you say and do is logged publicly and is associated with your IP address or your Rigs of Rods account (if signed in).

## General Conduct

1. Respect other players. Be courteous and avoid trolling, bullying, or harassing others.
2. No excessive profanity. Keep the language appropriate for all ages.
3. No griefing. Don't deliberately ruin other players' experiences (e.g., crashing into them without reason).

## Vehicle Usage

1. Avoid vehicle spamming. Don't spawn multiple vehicles unnecessarily, as it can lag the server.
2. Use reasonable vehicles. Choose vehicles that don’t cause extreme lag or performance issues for other players.
3. No excessive resetting. Avoid resetting your vehicle constantly, as it disrupts gameplay.

## Server Etiquette

1. Obey server rules and game moderators. Follow the server's instructions and listen to game moderators.
2. No hacking or exploiting. Using hacks, cheats, or exploiting glitches to gain an unfair advantage is strictly forbidden.
3. No advertising. Do not promote other servers or content unrelated to Rigs of Rods.

## Fair Play

1. Avoid disruptive behavior. Don’t intentionally ram, push, or interfere with other players’ vehicles without their consent.
2. Respect gameplay boundaries. Do not use features or vehicles that are banned on the server.

## Chat Rules

1. Respectful chat behavior. Don’t spam the chat or flood it with unnecessary messages.
2. Keep it relevant. Use chat for relevant communication, and don’t use it to argue or escalate conflicts.

## Reporting

1. Use proper channels. If you encounter issues such as griefing, rule violations, or inappropriate behavior, use the server’s reporting system.
2. Provide details. If you report using our Help Desk, please collect as much evidence as possible.
    - Player's name or username
    - Time of the incident
    - Description of the incident
    - Screenshots or video, if possible

If you see something say something, don't let others ruin your multiplayer experience.

## Sanctions

Game moderators are responsible for ensuring that the multiplayer experience adhere to community standards, and violations will be address in a fair and consistent manner.

Members can appeal disciplinary actions. If you feel that a warning, mute, or ban was applied unfairly, [you may appeal the decision on our Help Desk](https://helpdesk.rigsofrods.org). You may not contact any game moderator to appeal their decision. You may also not post in either the community forums or Discord server asking for the decision to be reversed.
